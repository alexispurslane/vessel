# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project
bunx sv create my-app
```

To recreate this project with the same configuration:

```sh
# recreate this project
bunx sv@0.15.1 create --template minimal --types ts --no-install .
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `bun install`, start a development server:

```sh
bun run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
bun run dev -- --open
```

> **Note:** The `dev` script uses `bun --bun vite dev` to run Vite with Bun's runtime instead of Node.js. This is required because the project uses `bun:sqlite` for the database, which is only available in Bun's runtime.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
